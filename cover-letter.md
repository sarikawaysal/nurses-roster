Welcome to the coding challenge! This challenge serves as the foundation for a technical interview where we will review your code together. 

Instructions for the task can be found in README.md inside the repository.

*The starter project code*:
The starter project contains code to handle input from the command line, code to output the results, and some test setup. You’re free to change this code in any way you see fit, but the inputs it accepts and the format of the output it produces should remain the same.
 
*Additional instructions*:
We value your time, so  please don’t spend any more than 2-3 hours on this task. The goals of this task, in priority order are

  * Familiarise yourself with the codebase we’ll be using in the tech interview
  * Demonstrate that you can think through the project and communicate your thought process
  * Demonstrate your ability to write quality code

If you don’t have time to complete the requirements, that’s totally fine also. We can chat through what you did get to in the next phase and have a chance to finish things off then.
 
Before submitting, please:

  * make sure the code runs, even if it doesn’t fulfills all the requirements
  * document your intentions in the readme

Here are some thing we will be looking at and can give feedback on in the session: 

  * the clarity, coherence, and structure of your code
  * idiomatic use of PHP
  * how you ensured the quality of your code (eg testing)

*How to submit*
  * Unzip the challenge, it will already have a .git folder
  * Create a new 
  * Commit your work (bonus point for clear commits)
  * Zip your folder and send it back to us
 
I will keep an eye out for your submission and will come back to you with feedback and next steps after we review it with the team.
